						<h2>Over the next 20 years  the US workforce will be going under the most dramatic paradigm shift since WW2.</h2>
						<p>American workers are already working harder than their western global counterparts with lower compensation and benefits. The reality is that more and more workers will find themselves in an “At Will" relationship with their employers meaning that they will have to fend for themselves to find health care and retirement benefits. Only a fraction of today's workforce will be "essential employees " with standard benefits, at best.</p>

						<h2 style="color:#000;">American workers have taken part time jobs to supplement their income to conteract this.</h2>
						<p style="color:#000;">One statistic states that 28% of Millennial's consider themselves entrepreneurs and have started freelance businesses. The new sharing economy (Uber, Airbnb) has helped fuel this momentum with the rise of temporary work spaces (WeWork, Yard, Grind) give these young start ups a physical space to launch their endeavors.</p>
